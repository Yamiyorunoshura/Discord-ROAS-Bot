# Security Integration

### Existing Security Measures
**Authentication:** Discord OAuth integration, role-based permissions system
**Authorization:** Admin/moderator role checking, rate limiting (100 requests/60s window)
**Data Protection:** Environment variable configuration, encrypted token storage
**Security Tools:** bandit security scanning, dependency vulnerability checking

### Enhancement Security Requirements
**New Security Measures:** Test data isolation, quality gate bypass prevention, secure CI/CD pipeline
**Integration Points:** dpytest mock security, test database access controls, quality tool authentication
**Compliance Requirements:** Maintain existing security posture, no new attack vectors through testing infrastructure

### Security Testing
**Existing Security Tests:** bandit scanning, dependency vulnerability checks
**New Security Test Requirements:** Test data isolation verification, quality tool access control testing
**Penetration Testing:** No new external interfaces exposed, internal security validation only
