# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

### Existing Infrastructure
**Current Deployment:** Docker Compose with multi-stage builds (development/testing/production targets)
**Infrastructure Tools:** Docker, Docker Compose, nginx reverse proxy, Prometheus monitoring, Grafana dashboards
**Environments:** Development, testing, production with profile-based service activation

### Enhancement Deployment Strategy
**Deployment Approach:** Extend existing Docker multi-stage builds to include quality assurance stages
**Infrastructure Changes:** Add quality gate stages to CI pipeline, integrate test result reporting
**Pipeline Integration:** Enhance existing Docker Compose profiles with quality assurance services

### Rollback Strategy
**Rollback Method:** Git-based rollback with Docker image versioning, maintain previous quality-passing versions
**Risk Mitigation:** Comprehensive test suite prevents regression, quality gates block problematic deployments
**Monitoring:** Enhanced monitoring of test coverage trends, quality metrics, and performance benchmarks
