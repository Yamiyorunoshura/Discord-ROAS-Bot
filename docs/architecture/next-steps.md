# Next Steps

### Story Manager Handoff

**For Story Manager Implementation:**

Based on this comprehensive brownfield architecture analysis, you now have a validated technical foundation for implementing the Discord ROAS Bot v2.3 quality improvement initiative. Key points for story development:

- **Architecture Foundation:** This document provides the complete technical blueprint based on actual project analysis, not assumptions
- **Integration Requirements:** All enhancement components are designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing modular cog architecture and dependency injection system
- **System Constraints:** Memory limits (512M Docker), performance requirements, and backward compatibility have been validated with the user
- **First Story Recommendation:** Begin with "Story 1.1: 建立測試基礎架構與 dpytest 整合" as it provides the foundation for all subsequent quality improvements

**Critical Implementation Sequence:**
1. Testing infrastructure setup (dpytest + pytest configuration)
2. Core module testing (foundation for all other modules)
3. Individual cog testing (achievement, currency, etc.)
4. Performance optimization (numpy integration)
5. Quality enforcement (ruff/mypy compliance)
6. CI/CD integration (automated quality gates)

**Existing System Integrity:** Every story must include verification that existing Discord commands, database operations, and user interactions remain completely unchanged.

### Developer Handoff

**For Development Team Implementation:**

This architecture document provides the complete technical specification for implementing comprehensive quality improvements while maintaining 100% compatibility with your existing Discord ROAS Bot system.

**Key Technical Decisions Based on Actual Project Analysis:**
- **Testing Strategy:** dpytest integration with your existing Discord.py 2.5+ framework
- **Quality Tools:** Leverage your existing ruff/mypy configuration in pyproject.toml
- **Performance:** numpy integration specifically for your computational modules (activity meter, achievement calculations)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL test schema isolation preserving your existing asyncpg patterns
- **Deployment:** Extension of your existing Docker Compose multi-stage builds

**Integration Requirements Validated with User:**
- Your modular cog architecture supports the proposed testing infrastructure
- Your dependency injection container can accommodate quality assurance services
- Your Docker deployment pipeline can handle the new dependencies
- Your existing database schema remains completely untouched

**Implementation Verification Steps:**
1. Each enhancement must pass existing test suite (no regressions)
2. All Discord commands must maintain identical behavior
3. Database operations must preserve existing performance characteristics
4. Memory usage must stay within your 512M Docker container limits
5. All code must pass the ruff/mypy quality gates before deployment

**Risk Mitigation:** The phased implementation approach ensures that any issues can be quickly identified and resolved without impacting your production Discord bot operations.
