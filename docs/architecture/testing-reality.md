# Testing Reality

### Current Test Coverage

- Unit Tests: Extensive framework in place
- Integration Tests: Database integration tests exist
- Performance Tests: Dedicated performance test directory
- Regression Tests: Dedicated regression test directory
- Panel Tests: Some panel functionality tests exist

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest                    # Run all tests
pytest tests/unit/        # Run unit tests only
pytest tests/integration/ # Run integration tests only
pytest -m "panel"         # Run panel-related tests
pytest -m "security"      # Run security tests
```

### Test Infrastructure Strengths

1. **Comprehensive conftest.py**: 903 lines of test configuration
2. **Multiple Database Fixtures**: Isolated test databases for each module
3. **Extensive Mock Objects**: Complete Discord object mocking
4. **Performance Testing**: Built-in performance monitoring
5. **Security Testing**: Malicious input testing capabilities

### Test Infrastructure Gaps

1. **dpytest Integration**: Currently disabled due to installation issues
2. **Coverage Reporting**: Not fully configured
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Needs enhancement
4. **Test Documentation**: Some tests lack clear documentation
