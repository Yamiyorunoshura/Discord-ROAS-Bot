# Enhancement Impact Analysis

### Files That Will Need Modification

Based on the testing enhancement requirements:

- `tests/conftest.py` - Enhance test infrastructure
- `tests/unit/` - Add missing unit tests
- `tests/integration/` - Enhance database and API tests
- `pytest.toml` - Update test configuration
- `pyproject.toml` - Add missing test dependencies

### New Files/Modules Needed

- `tests/unit/core_logic/` - Core ROAS calculation tests
- `tests/unit/panel_interactions/` - Panel interaction tests
- `tests/integration/api/` - Third-party API integration tests
- `tests/coverage/` - Coverage reporting configuration

### Integration Considerations

- Must work with existing extensive mock infrastructure
- Should integrate with current database isolation strategy
- Must maintain compatibility with existing test markers
- Should enhance rather than replace current test patterns
