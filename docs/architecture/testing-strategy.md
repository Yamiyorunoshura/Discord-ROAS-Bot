# Testing Strategy

### Integration with Existing Tests
**Existing Test Framework:** pytest with asyncio support, coverage reporting, multiple test categories
**Test Organization:** Existing test structure in tests/ directory with unit/integration/e2e separation
**Coverage Requirements:** Current 70% minimum, enhancing to 85% target for v2.3

### New Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests for New Components
- **Framework:** pytest with dpytest integration for Discord mocking
- **Location:** tests/unit/ mirroring src/ structure
- **Coverage Target:** 85% minimum coverage across all modules
- **Integration with Existing:** Extend existing pytest configuration, maintain marker system

#### Integration Tests
- **Scope:** Cross-module integration, Discord API interaction simulation, database transaction testing
- **Existing System Verification:** Comprehensive regression testing to ensure no existing functionality breaks
- **New Feature Testing:** Full testing of quality infrastructure, performance optimization verification

#### Regression Testing
- **Existing Feature Verification:** Automated test suite covering all existing Discord commands and database operations
- **Automated Regression Suite:** CI-integrated testing preventing quality degradation
- **Manual Testing Requirements:** Discord UI interaction testing for complex embed and modal scenarios
