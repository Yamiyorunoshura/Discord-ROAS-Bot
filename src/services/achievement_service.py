"""
Achievement Service Adapter for T2 Architecture Integration
Task ID: T2 - App architecture baseline and scaffolding

This module provides a corrected adapter for the existing achievement service,
fixing the architectural mismatch identified in Dr. Thompson's review.

ARCHITECTURE FIX: This adapter properly bridges the interface gap between 
new architecture expectations and existing system capabilities.

    - Achievement definition and management
    - Progress tracking and rewards
